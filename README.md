# LunaOS

LunaOS is a minimal Linux-based operating system template. This repository shows how to build a small custom distribution using Buildroot. It provides a simple script to fetch Buildroot, compile the kernel and root filesystem, and run it in QEMU.

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for full instructions.
